# btg_matrix


This project is a MERN stack for the wines by the glass (btg) list at my current restaurant job to serve as a wine matrix for employees to gain knowledge. It features 2 modes, one for admin and one for users.

<b>Admin mode:</b>
<br>
Allows one to view, update, add, or delete files/wines. Meant to be used on a desktop. 

Demo. Please give it a moment to let my backed to "wake up": https://jbcastro.github.io/admin_front/

<b>User mode:</b>
<br>
Allows a user to view each wine as a card with all the button features that exist in the admin mode. There is also a dropdown menu to view more about the wine, a color coded avatar pertaining to the type of wine it is, a search bar, and a filter clear button. The cards themselves are color coded to show the status of the wine, as in if it is new to the list or has been removed. The admin can also set status of wines to hidden which means that they are no longer on the list, will not show up in user mode, but will not be deleted from the database.
